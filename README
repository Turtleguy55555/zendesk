This is my Zendesk Ticket Viewer
This program was written in python using the pycharm ide
My main.py file has the entire ticket viewer code while the Tester.py file tests the code in main.py
In all honesty, I'm not sure how to write a guide on how to run my files. I just hope you are able to take my python files and are able to run it in an ide or command prompt.

I used a CLI system to view the tickets. First you will have to put in your credentials for your zendesk account. For this use mine:
  Username: david021301@gmail.com
  Password: Asmallturtle123!
 
 From there theres a menu to view tickets. If you enter "v" you can view all the tickets.
 You can then enter "next" or "prev" to page through all the tickets.
 
 If you want to view a specific ticket, you must first enter "v " then the id of a ticket. For example: "v 64" will allow you to view extra details on that ticket ONLY IF ticket
 id 64 is in the current page of tickets. (You can check this by looking at the id of the ticket in the current ticket list)
 
 You can run my tests seperately as well. I used python's unittest. In pycharm, there's a way to run unittests (I think it should default to this setting if you run my Tester.py file) 
 which will show you a summary of my tests.
